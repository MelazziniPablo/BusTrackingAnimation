# Bus Tracking Animation
A marker shows the Bus stops on a map
## Description of Project:
In this exercise we have the coordinates (longitude and latitude) of all the Bus Stops between the MIT and Harvard University. This animation will show with a marker on a map all the route a Bus takes between those two universities.
## How to run:
The page has a big button on the top left of the screen you only need to push it and the animation will show the marker moving from the MIT to the Harvard University showing all the Bus stops in between on the map.
## Future Improvements:
You can show the marker in a different route, as long as you have the Longitude and Latitude coordinates of any route. Also you can make a Real Time Bus Tracker by Obtaining the real time coordinates of a Bus in a specified route.
